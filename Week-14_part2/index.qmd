# Introduction

::: notes
In the previous weeks we talked about bibliographic structures, tools,
and standards that have been developed in LIS. For example, we
deconstructed the MARC record structure, which is used to create
bibliographic catalog records in OPACs.

We also looked at controlled vocabularies such as Library of Congress
Subject Headings as well as descriptive cataloging standards like AACR2
and RDA.

In Module 9.1, we stepped away from the library context and examined
what we can learn about users and how they organize their information
objects through a type of research called “personal information
management” or PIM.

PIM studies have explored how people organize the “stuff” in their home,
work, and digital environments. Through the envisioning exercises we
revisited who we think a user is today and what we need to know about
them to design useful information systems.

This lecture we will explore another non-bibliographic context – the
socially constructed spaces developed by communities of users online —
and the structures being developed in this context.

## Socially-Constructed Organizing Structures

::: notes
There are a whole host of different socially-constructed sites online.

In 1996 the first online bookmarking site was developed, soon followed
by many others, some that still exist today, like Flickr, and
LibraryThing.

In 2005 and 2006 some of the first social cataloging sites were
available. LibraryThing is a popular social cataloging site that
includes a space where the community of users can organize and describe
their collections, mostly books, add tags, read and share with others in
the community, participate in book clubs, etc.

The slide on this screen is an example of a record for the book
“Beautiful Evidence” by Edward Tufte, a guru on presentation and data
visualization design. You can see that 1,122 members also have added
this book to their collection, there are 7 reviews, and many users have
added tags to describe the subject or use of the book.

LibraryThing is a unique environment because the structure that is used
to describe the objects in a user’s collection was developed by the
community, not the developers of the site.

Through the Common Knowledge project, users collaborated in a wiki
“conversation” for about 6 months during which time they suggested
possible fields to add to a standard bibliographic record. These
suggestions were gathered and voted on and resulted in the structure
used today to describe objects in LibraryThing. Take a look online at
the entire field (metadata) structure that can be used:
<http://www.librarything.com/commonknowledge/>

LibraryThing also provides a widget that can be integrated into library
catalogs, called LibraryThing for Libraries (LTFL). This widget allows
the library OPAC to incorporate user-generated features into their OPAC.
For example, it adds a feature to the catalog that allows users to add
tags and reviews. There are many other additional features that are now
available in this LTFL service. To find out more, go to
<http://www.librarything.com/forlibraries> and check out some of
LibraryThingforLibraries latest enhancements.

## Socially-Constructed: Flickr

::: notes
A popular site, among many photo sharing sites, and one of the first
developed in 2005, is Flickr.

What I really want you to look at is the organization structure. Flickr
originally designed the site as a place for individuals to post and
share photos with family and friends.

It has grown into one of the most well used photo sharing sites
available online and has “morphed” into a very social environment where
people form groups, develop their own rules for describing images in
their group using “tags”, and basic protocols for how to interact in the
group.

The metadata includes elements that are generated by the digital camera
automatically and user-generated elements of name, collection name,
tags, additional info, geographic info, photostream info., etc. You can
set the permissions to friends, family, both, public so that you decide
who can view, comment, and tag your photos.

Flickr was one of the first environments that researchers began looking
at the issues with “tags” and “tagging” to provide subject access.

The tags once contributed and compiled form what is called a folksonomy.
This folksonomy is also called an “uncontrolled, controlled vocabulary”
because it is a list of tags that can be used to describe subjects and
descriptive elements of the photos but it is not controlled in the same
way as a controlled vocabulary like LCSH.

Folksonomies have been highly researched over the last 15 years or so
and many are in favor of their use. Others see them as messy,
inconsistent, “me-centric”, ambiguous, etc.

A few researches in LIS have actually compared their use to controlled
vocabularies like LCSH and have posited using them in library catalogs
in combination with controlled vocabularies. Of course this idea is not
without issues.

For example:

-   who will vet the tags?
-   who will determine what to include and exclude? - will there be
    “standards” or rules for users creating tags?

Catalogers are not keen on this idea and think it degrades the library
catalog and their work as catalogers.

What do you think? What are the advantages/disadvantages of
incorporating tags into the OPAC?

::: notes
Another example for floksonomy is The StoryGraph which was founded in 2019 and where readers contribute to mood add
content/target warning tags. It builds recommendations based on analyses
of readers' reading habits.

This flexibility allows for personalization, such as tagging based on
pace (e.g., "fast-paced" vs. "slow-burn"), emotional impact, or unique
themes.

## Socially-Constructed and Disciplinary - EOL

[![](images/clipboard-1021753111.png)](http://eol.org/)

::: notes
There are also socially-constructed sites that are discipline specific,
such as the Encyclopedia of Life.

This site is considered a “citizen science” site as it allows users to
post pictures of biological specimens they have found, classify them,
tag them, and converse with scientists.

Their About Us page states “Our knowledge of the many life-forms on
Earth - of animals, plants, fungi, protists and bacteria - is scattered
around the world in books, journals, databases, websites, specimen
collections, and in the minds of people everywhere.

Imagine what it would mean if this information could be gathered
together and made available to everyone – anywhere – at a moment’s
notice.”

Check it out for another perspective of how scientists think about and
organize information, as well as how “citizen scientists” can contribute
to what we understand about the world around us. It is also a great site
to use with middle and high school students.

We reviewed a few other discipline specific sites last week so take a
look at those also as you explore more about socially constructed sites.

::: notes
One of the newer sites used by academics and researchers is
"ResearchGate". On this site I can upload publications to share, view
who is citing my work, view pubs of researchers I have cited and that I
follow, and review other researchers and their research in areas of
interest to me. I can also join communities and follow other researchers
that I want to learn more about. I have found it useful to my research
work.

There are other sites academics use like Academia.com and CiteULike
which provide similar information and some info visualization/data
analysis tools that care useful to academics.
