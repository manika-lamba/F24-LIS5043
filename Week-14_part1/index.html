<h1>Introduction</h1>
<aside class="notes">
<p>In Module 9.1, we’re going to begin our discussion about non-bibliographic structures for organizing knowledge.</p>
<p>We’re going to talk about personal and professional contexts. The professional context will include also disciplinary views or also discipline specific views for how information can be organized in the domains of say, education or biology.</p>
<p>It will also look at some structures within LIS we’ve talked about in previous modules but think about them from a different perspective.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve thought in depth about our users in Module 3.1 and how those characterizations and expectations affect our libraries and our library services as well as other information contexts, let’s shift gears, and I’m going to have you envision a different aspect of information organization–that of what we call ‘personal information management.’</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>Alright, so keeping those two envisioning exercises in mind, let’s talk more about our users, but also about what we understand about how people organize information today.</p>
<p>It used to be that we knew who our users were – that we could characterize them based on their types and levels of knowledge, based on demographic factors, based on watching them in libraries or other information contexts. Can we still do that today? Our users are much more complex today than they used to be.</p>
<p>Also, we used to know what a collection was, and there were very distinct boundaries for a collection. Those of you that are creating organization systems for your big projects this semester are getting a taste of that. You have to characterize what a collection is and what’s included in that collection.</p>
<p>In today’s world collections do not necessarily have the same kinds of boundaries that they did previously. A collection can be extended onto the web. Many libraries have links out to ebooks that they’ve purchased. Also libraries’ catalog websites that they feel are important enough to include for their users.</p>
<p>We knew, well sort of, what constituted ‘data’, ‘information,’ ‘knowledge’, ‘wisdom.’ And I say ‘sort of’ because there’s still an ongoing debate about how we define each of these concepts. What is data? What is information? What is knowledge, and what is wisdom?</p>
<p>In 5033, you encountered this discussion, and I’m sure you’ve encountered it in other courses as well. We’re not going to try to solve this problem, we’re just going to acknowledge that there are differences of opinion about what constitutes each of these different concepts.</p>
<p>But how does that relate to today’s world and the organization of information. Think about the term now that’s so popular, ‘big data”. What does that actually mean? And libraries and information organizations in all contexts are grappling with how to deal with this concept of ‘big data.’</p>
<p>Even in the business community, it’s a large business now, there are new companies springing up that are developing software and providing tools, visualization capabilities to deal with big data.</p>
<p>But again, what is data? Is data just mainly metadata as we’ve thought about in the past? Is it unstructured data? Or is it data in a large data set? There’s lots of ways to think about it.</p>
<p>What is information? What are we actually organizing in our collections. At the bottom of the screen is what is called a ‘taxonomy.’ There are different nodes and branches. This taxonomy comes out of biology, of course, but it is another way of looking at taxonomic relationships within a collection or within an object itself, and how it relates to other objects.</p>
<p>So, there are more than just traditional ways of thinking about how information is organized and how we can make it meaningful in different contexts to different users.</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>Let’s start by defining ‘structures.’ You can think about structures in lots of different ways. One definition, by Pullen, who is an artist and philosopher of art, thinks about structures as “a fundamental and sometimes intangible notion covering the recognition, observation, nature, and stability of patterns and relationships of entities.” That’s a mouthful.</p>
<p>“From a child’s verbal description of a snowflake, to the detailed scientific analysis of the properties of magnetic fields, the concept of structure is an essential foundation of nearly every mode of inquiry and discovery in science, philosophy, and art.”</p>
<p>That is a very thoughtful, provocative way to think about structures, but it also speaks to the discussions we’ve been having this semester as you’ve learned more about how to organize information within various different contexts.</p>
<p>I really like how she talks about a child’s verbal description of a snowflake.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Where did a child learn the language to describe a snowflake?</p></li>
<li><p>Where did they learn about the properties of a snowflake or that every snowflake is different in some way?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We learned about Witttgenstein in the last lecture on classification. His theory of “language games” explains how children learn language in their everyday contexts and interactions.</p>
<p>If we look at a scientific analysis of the properties of snowflakes, we are no doubt going to have a different perspective than the child describing the snowflake, but is one perspective more relevant or appropriate than the other?</p>
<p>Again, context really comes into play when you think about how we describe a snowflake or a collection of snowflakes for our users.</p>

<section id="structures" class="slide level2">
<h2>Structures</h2>
<ul>
<li>Does the Pullen definition work completely?</li>
<li>Does it include the:
<ul>
<li>Life experiences</li>
<li>Understandings</li>
<li>Applications of the organizer or person creating either the structure or the values within the structure?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>What do YOU think is missing from the definition? How do you define structure(s)?</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>As you ponder that definition, I want you to also think about whether or not it includes the life experiences of different individuals, the understandings of different individuals and how they make meaning out of their own understandings of a concept or a phenomenon, and the different applications that we might apply when we’re representing a concept such as a snowflake.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it include the life experiences of the organizer or the person creating either the structure itself or the values within the structure?</li>
<li>Does it include the life experiences or understandings of the cataloger or the indexer who is creating a back of the book index for a children’s book about snowflakes?</li>
<li>Would there be differences in how someone who lived in Buffalo NY describes a snowflake versus someone who lives in Mexico who may never have seen a snowflake?</li>
<li>And lastly, what do you think is missing from the definition and how do you define ‘structures’?</li>
</ul>
<p>Structures really do underlie everything in our world in one way or another. Your library catalog has a very specific field structure associated with the records. The organization system you might use in your home has a structure behind it as well.</p>

<p>Let’s think about this a little bit more.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Why would you think about a snowflake in a particular way?</p></li>
<li><p>Is it something you learned about as a child?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you live in a part of the country that has a lot of snow in the winter versus living in a part of our country that has no snow?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Your definition or your representation might be very different as a result. Those types and levels of knowledge really come into play when we think about representing information for our different users.</p>
<p>I’m thinking of the types and levels of knowledge of the cataloger and the indexer, not necessarily the users.</p>
<p>What you see on the slide here is an actual representation of a digital library at the University of Buffalo created for a collection in a natural history museum, The Bentley Snow Crystal collection.</p>
<p>The metadata you see on the slide are the ‘classification,’ ‘snowflake,’ ‘creator,’ ‘date of Bentley’s journal,’ ‘crystal description,’ ‘weather data,’ ‘copyright,’ etc. Each of these were copied from Bentley’s journals.</p>
<p>The best way to represent this collection for this particular set of structures was to use Bentley’s own representation of each snowflake as written in his journals. The collection is fascinating from a historic perspective, from a scientific perspective, and from an aesthetic perspective.</p>
<p>This collection was created back in 2004, and that collection is still available online.</p>
<p>Think about how you would represent a snowflake if you were conducting research, if you were a scientist, or if you were designing a holiday card or looking for an example of crystal structures to show to a class.</p>
<p>You may have very different ideas of how that snowflake should be represented, and what’s on the slide is probably just one way of doing so.</p>

<h2>Types of Structures</h2>

<img data-src="images/clipboard-3002267013.png" class="r-stretch"><aside class="notes">
<p>We can also think about structures in various different ways and how they help us to organize information. And on this slide I have three different categories for thinking about structures. People have developed informal structures, formal structures, and combined structures.</p>
<p>Informal structures, for example, are those you use in your home–how you have your home collections organized.</p>
<p>Are they alphabetized, are they by genre, how is your spice cabinet organized?</p>
<p>Also, social sharing sites have different organization schemes in place. Concept maps can be considered informal structures. Those of you that have education as a background or have used concept maps in different courses are probably aware of concept maps and their structuring. Concept maps are a way to represent terminology or ideas in a connective visual display.</p>
<p>Formal structures are what we’ve learned a lot about in this class and that you’ve probably encountered throughout your daily lives, especially in your use of libraries. These are structures like our online library catalogs, or OPACs, and the MARC record structures within them; classification schemes, such as Dewey Decimal and Library of Congress; subject heading lists, such as Library of Congress Subject Headings; or thesauri–ERIC thesaurus is one of the examples we looked at in an earlier module; and even the Period Table of Elements is a formal structure for organizing the information of that discipline.</p>
<p>We also have what are considered ‘combined structures.’ These might be what you see in a very specialized context, such as small business ontology or database field structure, designed specifically for that environment and users.</p>
<p>An ontology generally represents the terminology that is meaningful to the individuals in that environment. A corporate taxonomy is very similar to an ontology, in that it’s at a more granular level of representing terms as well as different terms that are used in that context. And generally, these two types of structures are really only useful within the context for which they were created.</p>
<p>We also looked quite a bit in our first exercise on different types of displays of information in different retail or non-library contexts, such as art museums or nurseries or large department stores or electronics sections for electronic stores.</p>
<p>Each context had, as you found out, different ways of organizing information, but also there are some similarities across the different environments that you visited.</p>
<p>So, think about these different types of structures–the similarities, the differences, and how useful they are to our users.</p>

<h2>Traditional (Formal) Structures</h2>

<img data-src="images/clipboard-472091672.png" class="r-stretch"><aside class="notes">
<p>On this slide are some different examples of traditional formal structures that you have read about in the readings for this course, such as the Medical Code of Hammurabi, which was developed many years ago.</p>
<p>It was one of the very first ways of codifying the medical code within the medical profession in ancient times.</p>
<p>And then also scrolls. Scrolls were the way that information was captured years ago, and they were stored the same way.</p>
<p>The organization systems related to scrolls were pretty haphazard, though the person who curated the scrolls could generally find what they were looking for. There’s not a lot of information that we know about scrolls and how they’re organized, but your Taylor and Joudrey reading talks a little bit about the history of organization of different types of ancient materials.</p>

<p>We oftentimes would make these available to our users so they would have a source for search terms within our library catalogs, whether it was a print catalog or an electronic catalog.</p>
<p>And so we would lovingly call them our ‘five big, red book,’ but we know them also as the Library of Congress Subject Headings.</p>
<p>Now, we do not see these in libraries as often as we used to, and oftentimes catalogers are using electronic tools to find subject headings.</p>

<p>A very early example of a discipline-specific classification scheme is the one on the screen here by Caroli Linnaeus that was developed in 1735, and it still remains the way that we classify animals and plants within biology today.</p>
<p>So, whenever we’re talking about different types of either humans or homo sapiens, or plants or animals, we would use Linnaeus’ basic scheme.</p>
<p>Of course, this has changed and been expanded through the years, but it still remains our idea of classification of animals, of kingdom, phylum, class, order, genus, and species.</p>
<p>But it is very inclusive of this collection, if you will, that he was developing it for at the time.</p>
<p>It was developed in an era when natural history collection development was prevalent, and natural history collections were being developed in homes, in scientific institutions, in museums, and there needed to be a way to organize this information and the types of objects in these collections.</p>
<p>Linnaeus is a fascinating individual to study if you are interested in the history of the organization of information or the history of science.</p>

<p>Jumping ahead to the twenty-first century, we have very discipline-specific metadata schemes within the community of biology. The Abbas reading in Chapter 4 provides more examples of disciplinary uses and applications of knowledge structures within biology and other contexts as well. What’s on the screen is not Dublin Core, but you’ll see it’s very similar to it; however, this is a very specialized scheme for representing the biological world called the Darwin Core that was developed by the TDWG, which stands for the Taxonomic Database Working Group, which is now called the Biodiversity Information Standards Group.</p>
<p>So, there’s a large undertaking at a global scale to develop metadata schemas for representing biological collections in various different contexts.</p>

<p>You’ve probably encountered this taxonomy before. This is a knowledge structure within the social sciences, and more specifically within education. It’s called Bloom’s Taxonomy of Educational Objectives, or for short Bloom’s Taxonomy, developed by Bloom in 1956.</p>
<p>This taxonomy has a hierarchical structure representing six levels of thinking and learning skills that range from basic learning objectives, such as knowledge of content, to higher order learning, such as synthesis, evaluation, creativity. Bloom’s Taxonomy formed the basis for early work on the development of structural objectives for classes and curricula.</p>
<p>The other model on the slide is a revised version of Bloom’s Taxonomy which includes effective aspects of learning and making meaning within learning environments. This one was developed by Krathwohl, Bloom, and Masia in 1964 and incorporates the effective domain into the original taxonomy.</p>

<p>Okay, so let’s talk about some of our personal informal structures.</p>
<p>Researchers do not know a lot about how people organize their ‘stuff’ because it’s really difficult to study people in their home environments. We do know a lot more about how people organize their stuff in professional spaces, and also we’re becoming more aware of how people organize ‘stuff’ in digital environments. The citations on this slide are for three of your readings that are applicable to this idea of personal information management or PIM.</p>
<p>PIM is becoming more important in our world and in our discipline because of social environments, which we’ll address in the next lecture, but we are learning more about how people organize their ‘stuff’ in these environments, and that’s helping us improve the organization systems we’ve developed in libraries.</p>
<p>In home spaces we’ve looked at various different aspects, but there’s not a lot of research in our field in this area.</p>
<p>Most of the PIM research comes from environmental sciences, or in sciences that are interested in developing tools, such as computer science or what’s called ‘human computer interaction’ studies that look at developing tools to help us better organize our ‘stuff’ in numerous contexts.</p>

<p>In the Abbas chapter and also in the Marshall chapters, you can review the research related to home spaces, but the majority of our research has examined how people organize their lives in home environments–not necessarily how you organize your spice cabinet–though that is, of course, very illuminating.</p>
<p>We’ve looked at how people organize their lives through using different mechanisms, such as calendars or the “to do list” that we might keep–whether it’s a print list or one on your phone now–and other types of devices or tools that your family uses to organize ‘stuff’ and to organize your lives.</p>
<p>We also have looked quite a bit at the role of the main caregiver in the household–whether it’s a male or a female–and what they do in order to organize their family lives. It is fascinating research, and the result of this research is always to develop some type of technology to make their lives easier (we think), but this research also has implications for our own practice in libraries and other information organizations.</p>
<p>Learning how people may naturally organize their ‘stuff’ can help us design more user-centered spaces.</p>

<h2>Office Spaces</h2>

<img data-src="images/clipboard-4069210238.png" class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center r-stretch"><aside class="notes">
<p>Research called CSCW, Computer Supported Collaborative Work, from the HCI communities, examines how people organize their office spaces.</p>
<p>One particular area that I find particularly fascinating is the characterization of organization strategies of users as ‘filers’ versus ‘pilers’.</p>
<p>Think about your own way of organizing your home office or your space at home or your office in a work environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you pile stuff on your desk?</li>
<li>Do you pile it on the floor or on chairs?</li>
<li>Or do you file everything right away so that you have instant access to it?</li>
</ul>
<p>We characterize people as either ‘pilers’ or ‘filers’. I think I’m a hybrid; I think I do both. This research has shown us that people that are pilers can actually find what they’re looking for very quickly as opposed to those that file. They have their own system of organizing. They can find it, but others in their group or in the collaboration or work environments may not be able to find it.</p>
<p>CSCW work, of course, is designed to help us do our work more efficiently and also develop systems for helping us do so, but this research also has given us a good understanding about people and how they categorize information or how a group thinks about those categories, or even how to label group files labels.</p>
<p>In a digital environment, the folder names that you develop for your personal work may differ from those you assign when working on a project as part of a group. Labels would be assigned that are the most meaningful to the group, not the individual. This research has implications for us in terms of organizing information in libraries and information environments.</p>

<p>In summary, I hope you will read the readings for this module because they’ll give you so much more than I’m able to provide in this short lecture, but this area of our field, in HCI, and CSCW, is really fascinating.</p>
<p>Learning more about people and how they organize their ‘stuff’ in non-bibliographic contexts will really help you as an information professional, whether you’re in a library, an archive, in a corporate library, or some other information organization context outside of libraries.</p>
<p>Even in a retail environment, it can give ideas for better organization at a user-centered perspective.</p>
<p>Some of the implications for practice are listed on this slide. I am sure you can think of others as well. Understanding our users really helps us make decisions about how we organize collections in libraries, for example; how we categorize information objects; how we classify information objects; the subject terms that we apply when we’re cataloging or indexing something in our collections.</p>
<p>It also speaks volumes to the expectations of the search process that our users have. You know, they want quick, ubiquitous, 24/7 access to information, and they want to be able to find information with just a few terms, just like a search engine, whether it’s returning appropriate materials or not.</p>
<p>PIM also helps us understand their decision making criteria and the types of information we need to have in our representations.</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>From a practical, user-centered perspective, it helps us choose elements for system design; for example, what fields to include in the system. What fields to index or make searchable.</p>
<p>Or even the creation of input rules so that the person creating those representations will know exactly how to create them.</p>
<p>It also has implications for interface design and retrieval in terms of different functions that we want to make available to our users in our web interfaces or other environments.</p>
<p>It also helps us choose appropriate controlled vocabulary or other vocabularies to use, whether it’s user tags or natural language taken from the resource itself or terms the cataloger or indexer adds that are more current-use than what we see in subject headings.</p>
<p>It also helps us choose appropriate level of indexing in terms of exhaustivity and specificity that we discussed earlier or even the basic idea of how many subject terms to include in our representations.</p>
<p>So, again, understanding more about our users in various different contexts really has a lot of important implications for practice.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>I wanted to look again at Borgman’s thoughts on online catalogs. Borgman was one of the original LIS researchers who wrote about catalogs and online catalogs and why they are still hard to use.</p>
<p>Her work posed the question about why our library catalogs had not changed much throughout the years. We still access our catalogs in pretty much the same way–by fielded searches for author, title, and subject.</p>
<p>Newer catalogs have expanded to include more attributes of our collections that could be represented to our users. Our representations in the era of card catalogs had to fit into a cookie cutter system. They were really very small cards that we could use to represent each item in the collection.</p>
<p>When we moved into the MARC environment, originally we stayed pretty much with that model, but we have significantly expanded since that point.</p>
<p>Also, with our second generation catalogs, we can incorporate a lot of new search functionalities, such as faceted searching and different types of browsing that are more user-centered.</p>
<p>Also, some systems are allowing us to tag or users to add tags to different resources that may be more appropriate than the subject terms we are using. And we have begun to include features that make our catalogs more social, or allow for crowdsourcing.</p>
<p>Of course we should think about the implications of doing so. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>do we really want to have user tags floating around in our libraries?</p></li>
<li><p>Are they appropriate?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We have to think about vetting and the whole process as a cataloger tasked with incorporating tags.</p>
<p>So, it’s not just a straightforward idea of just “Yes, that’s great because they are users’ tags and they are more common language, more meaningful to the user.” There are several issues that have to be resolved.</p>
<p>And again, our systems still use very specialized knowledge that requires us to understand the semantic representations, or how we have strung together subject headings in our catalogs and how our system works with those–if it parses them apart or if requires exact match.</p>
<p>Also, our users have to understand the syntactic aspects of using our catalogs–how to enter a query into the catalog, or can they use a dropdown box?</p>
<p>All of this is really still pretty much the same as it has been for years with the exception of the newer browsing capabilities in second generation catalogs.</p>
<p>As you progress through this module, keep this discussion in mind.</p>
<p>In Module 9.2 you’re going to think about representation of information in different ways, but also within social sharing environments, or socially constructed environments, of social media or social cataloging</p>
