# Introduction

::: notes
In Module 3.1, we're going to talk about users and information seeking
behavior. This becomes very important to us: one, as someone who's
helping users find information in retrieval systems, but also for those
that design information systems and databases that help users connect
with information.

In this multi-lecture topic, we will first talk about users and their
information behavior broadly, but also why it is important that we
understand users to provide them with better organized collections and
organization systems.

In Module 3.2, we will learn more about information retrieval and
user-centered design and how these both relate to information
organization and users.

In Module 3.3, which is an optional lecture, I will introduce you to
some tips and advanced search techniques to use in information retrieval
systems, like OU Libraries' databases.

## Important Questions

-   `Who are Users?`
-   `What can we know about Users?`
-   `How do users seek and search for information?`
    -   Examples of models for search and information seeking behavior

::: notes
So let's talk about our users. Some questions to frame our thinking:

-   Who are our users?
-   What can we know about users?
-   How do users seek and search for information?

We will also look at some different models that have been developed in
Library and Information Science \[LIS\] through the years, primarily
starting in the 1980s about how users look for information. So, these
are some questions to help frame our thinking. Let's talk about each of
these aspects individually.
:::

## Who Are Users?

`A user is a person who uses information and/or information systems in some meaningful way`

::: notes
First, let's look at "Who are our users?"

A user, very broadly defined, is "a person who uses information and/ or
information systems in some meaningful way."

Now, meaningful is a very subjective term, and you're thinking "what
does she mean by meaningful?"

And generally, it's up to the user to decide if their interaction with
the system has been useful.

Now, I'm not just talking about automated systems, technical systems.
I'm talking about systems in general.

You know, walking into the library and talking to a reference librarian
would be part of a system's interaction. I'll explain that in just a few
minutes, but users are anyone that really uses our system to find what
they're looking for, to solve an information need. And there are lots of
different terms that you're going to see in the literature that refer to
users.

In the 80's and the 90's we've called them "patrons" and "end users" and
"system users". We used to refer to librarians, specifically reference
librarians, as search intermediaries, so you might see that in the
literature, but that was primarily in the late 80's and early 90's. But
now we just call them users.

::: notes
Okay, so who exactly is today's user?

I've given you some pictures on this slide to think through what a user
or who a user is, but one thing that you'll notice, of course, is that
there is either a computerized or virtual or a print based technology in
place in each of these pictures.

You will notice, computers, much of what you would see in most of the
libraries today with various different people of different genders or
ages accessing the Internet or using computer systems within their
library context.

You also have to think about users in terms of age groups. We have young
users that are interacting with and adapting technology in ways that we
did not anticipate, which is very exciting for us as library and
information professionals, but it's also very challenging because we now
have to think about how do we engage with the users and help them become
better information consumers as well as creators of information.

And we cannot forget that people still like to browse our libraries.
People traditionally are used to going through the stacks, finding
something they like and then looking at the books around the book to
determine if there's something else that they find of interest or that's
related to their information need. So, classification systems are still
very relevant in libraries. That's not to say that the systems in place
are the best systems or the most user-friendly systems for this new
generation of user, but they do still support users in very important
ways.

A really interesting dimension of users, and this came about, of course,
with the Internet and more social ways of sharing information or
participating in online communities, is what is being called "citizen
science".

Also, we have very wired individuals as users today where a user is
connected to internet 24/7. These users are using different tools like
smartphones or tablets in ways that allow them to access information but
also to share and create information and engage in different practices
with other users. These are all dimensions of users we as information
professionals have to think about.
:::

## Model of Today's User

> *[Work in Progress?!]{style="color: blue;"}*

::: notes
So, when we think about today's users, it's really difficult to model
the user today because of all the different technology that they
interact with on a daily basis and all the different resources they have
available to them at their fingertips.

So, let's think about the user as a "work in progress" as we work
through this lecture on users and information behavior.
:::

## Some More Vocabulary

- `Information`: any difference you perceive in your environment or within yourself
- `Information need`: recognition that your knowledge is inadequate to satisfy a goal you have
- `Information seeking`: conscious effort to acquire information in response to a need or gap in your knowledge
- `Information behavior`: information seeking, as well as other unintentional or passive behaviors, or other purposive behaviors such as avoiding information

::: notes
Some other vocabulary that might be useful for understanding this dimension of information seeking and organization of information.

In this program you will read lots of definitions of **information**. One definition I find particularly useful is: *information is any difference you
perceive in your environment or within yourself*.

So, we can think of information in lots of different ways. We can think of it as a cognitive change that comes about when we learn something new or we encounter some new piece of information. We can think of "information-as-thing," or as physical
objects actually being thought of as information bearing Or having the ability to inform us in some way. So, there are lots of different ways we can
think of information.

**Information need** then is that recognition that you have that your knowledge is somewhat inadequate in a particular area and you need to find something else out in order to satisfy a goal that you have. For example, if you want to learn about designing webpages, you're probably going to go to a class, or
you're going to find a book that will help you with this, or you might even go
on the web and find different information. But you're going to access systems,
resources, in order to find information to solve your information problem.

Another term is **information seeking**, and this is a conscious effort to acquire information in response to a need or gap in your knowledge. Think about your daily activities. Many of you probably got up this morning, turned on a computer or tablet, turned on the television, listened to the news, got information about the weather, so you could decide what you're going to wear today or if you need an umbrella. You
probably have talked on the phone to someone today. At different points during your
day, you have been encountering or accessing different systems to find information.

**Information behavior**, then, is kind of this overall umbrella of information seeking as well as other unintentional or passive behaviors or other purposeful behaviors related to seeking (or not seeking) information, such as avoiding information. 

Now, how many of you have heard of cognitive dissonance? It comes from cognitive science. Cognitive dissonance is where you avoid information that you know is going to change something that you've already made a decision about or something that you've already done and you don't really want to encounter that information because you know it's going to make you feel bad about your decision. That's just one way of looking at it. So, for example, you've just made a major purchase, like you bought a
new car. And then you get on the website or you hear consumer reports or something telling you how bad that car is and that you really shouldn't have bought it in the first place, and that's the idea of avoiding information.

Also, it's interesting in our field because of what we call the information glut, or the
information overload. That people purposely filter our information sources in their
lives because they don't want to be overwhelmed with all this different kinds of information. For instance, I don't turn on the news before 8:00 because I don't want to know what's going on until I'm ready for it. 

But that's one way in which we avoid information. Turning off the radio while you're driving, things like that. When we look at information behavior, we look at not just purposeful
information seeking, but we look at avoidance activities as well.

So, it's a really interesting area of our field that tells us a lot about people and how our information can be represented for them in order to effect access to that information.

So, what do we need to know about the people we call our users?
:::

## What do We Need to Know?

- `Demographics`
- `Types & Levels of Knowledge`
- `Information-Seeking Situations`

::: notes
Well, there are certain things we can know, and there are certain things we can make some generalizations about, such as demographics, types and levels of knowledge, and information seeking situations. Let's address each of these
separately.
:::

## Demographics 

- `Age`
- `Gender`
- `Education`
- `Occupation`
- `Culture` *(values, language, ethnicity)*


::: notes
**Age** is one way that we can get a good picture about a user group. And we can characterize age in many different ways. Our society has created
these frameworks in order for us to do so. We can think about age in terms of K-5, K-12, young adult, adult, senior citizen, children. We put all these different labels on it. So, that's one way in which we can get a handle on one
characteristic of our user group.

Also, **gender**, are they primarily males and females? In earlier studies of computer adoption studies this demographic was a real factor. It's not as much today as it used to be, but again there are still studies that show that males are
heavier users of different kinds of information technology than females are, but that's shifting.

What's really interesting about some of our studies today with gender is that we're seeing that particularly in the web and in the
internet environment is that we have different uses - that each gender has a different use. Females tend to use more of the communicative aspects of the web and internet than males. And males generally - and I don't like to generalize, but studies have shown this - are more into the information gathering and gaming and more of the
high tech applications.

So it's kind of interesting what we can tell about a user population based on the different variables. But this is shifting constantly.


**Education** can tell us a lot about a user group. It tells us about their potential knowledge, about their subject and domain expertise; it tells us about potential uses
they might have for that information that they're looking for. So, education level can tell us quite a bit.

**Occupation** is the same. If we know that someone is an engineer or chemist or a
contractor or a builder, they're going to have a different knowledge base potentially. And so
it's interesting to be able to tell what their occupation is because that again will tell us something again about what they're going to be looking for, what kind of resources would be useful for them.

**Culture** is a little bit of a grayer area. But it does tell us a little bit about values and
ethnicity and ethnic choices that people make. But also language. Especially if you're
designing a system. You need to know what kind of language or what languages your users need in order to access your system. Is it a multilingual system? Do you have a very heavy multilingual population, and how do we adapt that within the system environment? So, even language can be a very important variable to know about our users. We have a sparsity of studies related to cultural aspects of information behavior and users.
:::

## Types and Levels of Knowledge

Allen (1991)

- `World Knowledge`
- `System Knowledge`
- `Task Knowledge`
- `Domain Knowledge`

::: notes
The second set of information that we can know about our users is what we call "types and levels of knowledge": 

- world knowledge
- system knowledge
- task knowledge 
- domain knowledge

And others have expanded on this idea as well. So, let's break them each down.
:::

## World Knowledge

- `World View, Perception of Self`

- `Affects Self-Confidence`

::: notes
Now, we can look at them separately, but you can also see the connections and the overlap between all these types of levels of knowledge.

For example, **world knowledge** is a user's perception of himself and the role that they play in the world - in their own world. And it's really, world knowledge, is a combination of the other three knowledge rolled into one. This
is kind of from a constructivist learning point of view - that you build or construct your own world based upon what you encounter, what's in your society, and that frames and shapes your perception of yourself and the role that
you play.

Why this is important to us is that it will affect a user's self-confidence when they're working with a particular system, when they're looking for information, when they're coming to the reference desk and asking questions. So, somebody with high world knowledge, someone who has traveled a lot, someone who has a real broad view of the world and different pieces of the
world, and has a good sense of how they *fit*
in the world, is probably a more confident user of information and information sources.

## Metadata and Metadata Schemes {.smaller}

-   Data about an entity
-   It is a
    "`structured information that describes, explain, locates, or otherwise makes it easier to retrieve, use, or manage an information resource`"
    (NISO, 2017:1)
-   Metadata scheme consists of metadata elements
    -   Library catalog metadata scheme (MARC) contains
        `metadata elements` for title, author, subject, publisher, etc
-   Metadata element represents an `attribute of the object`

::: footer
[Understanding Metadata: A
Primer](https://groups.niso.org/higherlogic/ws/public/download/17446/Understanding%20Metadata.pdf)
:::

::: notes
OK, we cannot leave this lecture without at least introducing the
concepts metadata and metadata schemes. I know, I have been using these
terms throughout this lecture but it is logical to present them here
again, as the result of the data modeling we just did (identifying
entity level and attributes) is the development of a metadata scheme.
AND the data we enter in the record to describe the object is metadata.

The concept metadata is most often defined simply as "data about data"
or "information about information".

Librarians have been creating metadata for hundreds of years, we just
did not have this sexy name, we called it cataloging.

I prefer to think of metadata as "structured data representing an
information object". We don't simply add a few words to describe an
object, we make informed decisions and follow specific rules and
standards for how to create the representation or the metadata.

The term "metadata" was used before the advent of the Internet,
primarily in computer science to specify information about database
objects and/or program objects.

When you structure metadata into a system, you are actually creating a
metadata scheme, or the field structure in a database, or the list of
attributes or elements you will use to represent the objects in your
collection. The MARC scheme we use in libraries is an example of an
early metadata scheme. There are many more.
:::

## Purpose and Functions of Metadata {.smaller}

-   `Purpose`: represent an entity
-   `Functions`
    -   Discovering or finding that an entity exists
    -   Evaluating or selecting an entity
    -   Locating or accessing an entity
    -   Others such as collection management, rating content, managing
        intellectual property rights
-   `Application areas`
    -   Libraries
    -   Websites
    -   Government agencies
    -   Museums

::: notes
The main purpose of metadata is of course to represent an information
object.

However, because the term was coined for use in the digital environment
(though it is also used in an analog context as well), the functions we
saw earlier of a library catalog are slightly augmented.

For example, we find present in some metadata schemes what is called
"administrative metadata" or information that represents administrative
activities associated with the object, such as when it was donated and
by whom, who owns copyright and how might the object legally be used,
any content ratings, what collection it is part of, etc. You might also
find metadata specific to the digital capture of the object, such as
scanner used, resolution of image(s), date scanned and by whom, etc.
:::

## Power of Metadata: Structure

![](images/3.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

::: notes
This slide illustrates the power of the STRUCTURE behind the metadata.
Without the structure (left side of screen), we have a bunch of words
that describe something, but our computerized systems cannot understand
these data, nor can the computer process them. If the left hand side of
the screen were typed on a piece of paper, HOW would we organize it in a
library catalog? In any information system?

The right hand side of the screen shows how the structured fields in the
metadata scheme provide a useful framework for the system to process and
for users to make some sense of.
:::

## Metadata Elements and Semantics {.smaller}

::: panel-tabset
## Introduction

-   Each element needs a name
-   Each element needs a definition (semantics)
-   The semantics describe the information content associated with an
    element
-   Input rules associated with an element

::: notes
Let's break down the parts of a metadata scheme.

Each scheme contains multiple elements. In MARC they are represented
using numeric tags in the range of 0XX-9XX. We will examine the MARC
structure in more depth in Module 7.2

Each element (or think about an element as a field in a database) has
three parts:

1)  a name to identify the element in the field structure
2)  a definition or what is called a semantic, which explains to the
    record creator (and users) what to expect to find entered in that
    field
3)  Input rules or standardized rules for how to create the content
    entered into that field

Any organization system contains a metadata scheme, regardless of
context or form.

## Introduction (Cont.)

![](images/4.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

## Dublin Core {.smaller}

-   15 elements to represent digital resources
-   Also used for analog resources

![](images/5.png){fig-align="center" width="40%"}

## Many Metadata Schemes

-   Government Information Locator Service (GILS)
    -   Metadata scheme for describing government information
    -   67 elements
-   Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC)
    -   Metadata scheme for describing geospatial information
    -   100+ elements
-   Encoded Archival Description (EAD)
    -   Used within the archival community
-   And many more....
    -   Visual Resources Core, MODS, etc.
:::

::: notes
**Intro 2** -- Here is an example of a metadata element and its parts
taken from one of the most well-known and used metadata schemes, the
Dublin Core. Can you see what is MISSING?

**Dublin core slide** ---- An example of a metadata scheme is the Dublin
Core, developed in the mid 1990's and still being reworked today.

It includes a core set of 15 generic elements at its base, though there
are now many more that have been added to the scheme.

We will come back to Dublin Core and other metadata schemes later but
take some time to explore some of them online and to look at the
different collections they are being used in.

**more scheme** --- Just some more great examples to explore. Look these
up using your favorite search engine.

## Focus So Far, Upcoming Weeks

-   Structuring the representation
    -   Selecting object attributes to represent (based on users, user
        questions, and collection's objects)
    -   Labeling attributes through the metadata elements/field names
    -   Defining the elements (semantics) to indicate information about
        object to record
-   In a few weeks we will try some data modeling

::: notes
This lecture has been a very quick and simple introduction to the
complex concepts of representation and surrogation, bibliographic
control and tools, and metadata and metadata schemes, as well as to the
process and some decisions we make when developing an organization
system.

In the readings for the module you will explore these concepts, tools,
and processes further.

In Module 7, we will take a more in depth look at the application of
representation and a metadata scheme when we discuss bibliographic
control.

Later we will look further at systems and metadata schemes.

Enjoy the readings and be sure to ask questions or post insights as you
read.
