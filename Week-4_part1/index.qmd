## Model of Information Retrieval {.smaller}

![](images/1.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

::: notes
In Module 3.2 we’re going to talk about information retrieval (IR) from
different perspectives. We’re first going to talk about the idea of
representation within information systems, and how it affects
information retrieval. Then we will look at some different information
retrieval models that are present in today’s systems, as well as look at
some of those in earlier systems.

To begin our discussion, here is the recap of the model from Module 2 to
help you think through the idea of multiple representations and how they
interact to connect users to information.

Representation A is the user’s information need, which the user enters
into a system using terms that they believe represent this need.

Representation B is the representation created as a surrogate for the
information object by a cataloger or indexer. Often the cataloger will
use a set of authorized terms, called a controlled vocabulary to
represent the subjects, but also a set of standards that tell them how
to describe the object within the representation.

Both are entered into a system.

The retrieval component of the information system matches these two
representations and brings back a subset of representations that the
system contains that are representative of the words in the users
queries. (We won’t go into the mechanics of searching at this point, or
how the retrieval mechanisms work within various systems.)

The user then chooses a representation to review to see if it meets
their information need or not.
:::

## Representation: Definition

-   A system for choosing or highlighting some characteristics
    (attributes), together with a specification of the rules for
    selection (codes)

-   This implies a trade-off: if some characteristics are highlighted,
    other characteristics are left behind

::: notes
Next, let’s begin by defining ‘representation’ within the broader
context. Now you’ll recall, we talked about representation in Module 2,
but let’s look even more specifically at some of the issues related to
representation within IR systems.

Representation can be thought of as a system for choosing or
highlighting some characteristics, or attributes – or general
characteristics -- together with the specification of the rules for
selection and the code, meaning that we should understand a little bit
about how the system is structured and how data exists within the
system’s records.

This selection (or surrogation ) process implies a trade - off of some
kind. If some characteristics are highlighted, then we have to assume
that other characteristics are left behind.

So, for example, in library catalogs we made decisions on what
attributes of the information objects in our collection are important to
describe in our records for users. In early catalog records these
attributes included, Title, Author, Subject, and Classification.

In order to create those representations, the card catalog records, we
had to decide which characteristics to highlight and which to leave
behind.
:::

## More Definitions {.smaller}

-   `ENTITES`: objects or concepts
-   `ATTRIBUTES`: characteristics of entities
    -   `DIACHRONIC`: stable across time
    -   `SYNCHRONIC`: changes across time

::: notes
Okay, let’s also look at some other definitions that we need to
consider.

In terms of representations, we have to consider the term of ‘entities.’
Entities are those objects, or even concepts, that we’re going to
represent.

‘Attributes’ are the general characteristics of information objects. So,
we can also think of them as characteristics of the entities that we’re
representing. There are different types of attributes; ‘diachronic’ and
‘synchronic’ attributes.

Diachronic attributes are those that remain stable across time. In other
words, they do not change, and their meanings and uses also do not
change.

And then there are synchronic attributes, and those are attributes that
change across time. The change could be as simple as the use of a
particular term or concept within a specific language.

##  {.smaller}

![](images/2.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

::: notes
On this slide I have modelled the idea of how
*agency*
plays a role in the information
representation and retrieval process. 

For example, we have an agency, which
might be your local cataloging department, or it could be an indexing service within a
database. That agency has a
*document representation rule*
, meaning that they have
predefined the structure in that
particular system
. And then they’ve also made
choices in terms of controlled vocabulary use,
whether or not
they use a controlled
vocabulary or the specific one that they do use. And they may also have a
*question representation rule*
, meaning that a user
has to
input our question into the system
using a specific format or syntax and it will be matched to the representations using
a specific algorithm.

Also,
part of this model is the
*retrieval mechanism rule*
. That particular system has a
structure, such as the file structure or field structure. The retrieval mechanism rule
would also include the types of data in the fields, how that data is retrieved, how it’s
indexed within a system
–
whether or not
a field is searchable, and then also the
algorithms that match the user’s query terms to the representations (records) within
the system.
:::

## Human Indexing

- Diachronic Attributes (do not change)
  - *author, title, publisher, number of pages*
- Only most general thought of users
- Rules not evident to users
- *Great vagueness & Generality resting on a foundation of shiftiing quicksand*

::: notes
So, we think of representation of information objects as including two
primary challenges:

1)  How to represent each object as a unique, container-oriented thing

2)  How to represent each object as sources on various subjects that
    might be found in other objects in our collection, content oriented
    and also how this object is related to others of like subject
:::

## Relations in the Bibliographic Universe

![](images/2.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

::: notes
In libraries, we refer to objects that we can actually represent as
being part of the bibliographic universe, an abstract subset of what is
called the "Universe of Knowledge" in LIS.

Objects in the bibliographic universe are those that have been RECORDED
in some manner/form. It does not include objects that are in a purely
oral form (having not been recorded in some medium yet), such as spoken
stories.

Once these stories are recorded onto audio tapes/video/digital forms,
then we can organize them. While the term bibliographic universe stems
from a library context, it can be extended to any context, as can the
relationships between the objects in one's collection. For example, in a
corporation, the products produced by a company are what would be
organized, say, company reports, white papers, working papers, concept
briefings, emails of specific committees, etc. While we don't think of
these objects in the traditional sense of "collection", they are indeed
objects in a bibliographic universe that can be organized.

What other examples of contexts, collections, objects can you think of?

What other relationships?
:::

## Identifying Relationships {.smaller}

-   `Separate containers, same content`
    -   Different formats
-   `Separate containers, similar content`
    -   Translation, abridged, versions, editions
-   `Seperate containers, same author, different content`
    -   Link together all objects by author
-   `Seperate containers, different authors, similar content`
    -   Link together all objects by subject
-   `Unique representations of container`
-   `Relationships established through various means`
    -   Name authority control
    -   Controlled vocabulary

::: notes
Just reiterating the last slide and some relationships.

Two new concepts here that we did not discuss earlier: name authority
and controlled vocabulary.

We will address these concepts in later modules, but briefly, we
establish preferred (or authorized) forms of names (personal, corporate,
product, etc.) and of terms that express subject matter.

We assert this control so that we have a standardized form of the name
or subject term, so that each time we use them in our representations,
they are entered in the same form.

This standardization ensures consistency in our representations, our
database records, and effects more efficient retrieval in our
information systems.

Look up both terms in the readings to see what the authors have to add
to this conversation
:::

## Bibliographic Tools (Instruments) {.smaller}

-   Mechanisms by which bibliographic control is established and
    maintained
-   Examples of tools (contain representations)
    -   Library catalog\
    -   Bibliographic
    -   Indexes to journal literature\
    -   Finding aids
-   Three functions of all bibliographic tools
    -   Identification or finding
    -   Collocation or gathering
    -   Evaluation or selecting
-   Representations must support these functions

::: notes
In a library context, we call the creation of surrogates by several
names, bibliographic control (control of the bibliographic universe),
cataloging, indexing, etc. I personally like Patrick Wilson's vision,
"bibliographic harmony"---where we strive to provide a harmonizing
effect between the representations in our catalogs/information systems
so that users can find what they are looking for.

In libraries, we call the tools that we have created to effect
bibliographic control (harmony), bibliographic tools or instruments.

There are many examples and I have listed a few here. The readings for
this module will cover these in more depth and give you additional
examples.

The functions of all bibliographic tools are to provide for: 1)
Identification or finding 2) Collocation or gathering 3) Evaluation or
selecting

These functions are the original objectives of a library catalog that
Charles Ami Cutter developed back in the early 1900s. And they really
have not changed much since. Abbas and Taylor will take you through some
of the rich history of the development of bibliographic tools in the
readings for this module.

Representations must support these three functions, in other words, they
should include elements that help users identify or find a specific item
in the collection or a specific subject; they should collocate or gather
together all items by a specific author, title, or about a specific
subject; and they should assist users in the evaluation or selecting of
the object they need to satisfy their info need.

WHAT other functions can you think of that could be included in a
surrogate in a library context? In other context? WOULD they really be
any different?
:::

## Representation Responsive to Users {.smaller}

-   `What to users want to do?`
    -   [Search?]{style="color: orange;"}
    -   [Evaluate?]{style="color: orange;"}
-   `How do our representations support their tasks?`
-   Library catalog representations support
    `four generic user tasks (FRBR)`
    -   [Find]{style="color: orange;"}
    -   [Identify]{style="color: orange;"}
    -   [Select]{style="color: orange;"}
    -   [Acquire or obtain]{style="color: orange;"}

::: notes
As noted earlier, representations should be responsive to your users. In
order to design "user-centered" systems and representations, we have to
know a little about how users interact with our systems, how they
search, what they want to do with our systems and with representations.

Think about a general library catalog record. How do these
representations support user tasks? A landmark study called the FRBR
(Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records) study was one of the
first and one of the very few studies we have conducted to learn more
about how users view our bibliographic records and information systems,
as well as the tasks they hope to accomplish while using library
catalogs/catalog records. Maxwell's reading in a later module will talk
more about FRBR. Also be sure to explore the FRBR and RDA websites to
learn more.

You can see on the slide that three of the original objectives proposed
by Cutter years ago still hold. FRBR studies identified an additional
one: to acquire or obtain the object.

So, what needs to be present in a surrogate so that users can satisfy
the FRBR tasks? Should the representation be more generic or
specialized? Can you think of instances in which representations would
be customized for specific user groups?
:::

## Metadata and Metadata Schemes {.smaller}

-   Data about an entity
-   It is a
    "`structured information that describes, explain, locates, or otherwise makes it easier to retrieve, use, or manage an information resource`"
    (NISO, 2017:1)
-   Metadata scheme consists of metadata elements
    -   Library catalog metadata scheme (MARC) contains
        `metadata elements` for title, author, subject, publisher, etc
-   Metadata element represents an `attribute of the object`

[Understanding Metadata: A
Primer](https://groups.niso.org/higherlogic/ws/public/download/17446/Understanding%20Metadata.pdf)
:::

::: notes
OK, we cannot leave this lecture without at least introducing the
concepts metadata and metadata schemes. I know, I have been using these
terms throughout this lecture but it is logical to present them here
again, as the result of the data modeling we just did (identifying
entity level and attributes) is the development of a metadata scheme.
AND the data we enter in the record to describe the object is metadata.

The concept metadata is most often defined simply as "data about data"
or "information about information".

Librarians have been creating metadata for hundreds of years, we just
did not have this sexy name, we called it cataloging.

I prefer to think of metadata as "structured data representing an
information object". We don't simply add a few words to describe an
object, we make informed decisions and follow specific rules and
standards for how to create the representation or the metadata.

The term "metadata" was used before the advent of the Internet,
primarily in computer science to specify information about database
objects and/or program objects.

When you structure metadata into a system, you are actually creating a
metadata scheme, or the field structure in a database, or the list of
attributes or elements you will use to represent the objects in your
collection. The MARC scheme we use in libraries is an example of an
early metadata scheme. There are many more.
:::

## Purpose and Functions of Metadata {.smaller}

-   `Purpose`: represent an entity
-   `Functions`
    -   Discovering or finding that an entity exists
    -   Evaluating or selecting an entity
    -   Locating or accessing an entity
    -   Others such as collection management, rating content, managing
        intellectual property rights
-   `Application areas`
    -   Libraries
    -   Websites
    -   Government agencies
    -   Museums

::: notes
The main purpose of metadata is of course to represent an information
object.

However, because the term was coined for use in the digital environment
(though it is also used in an analog context as well), the functions we
saw earlier of a library catalog are slightly augmented.

For example, we find present in some metadata schemes what is called
"administrative metadata" or information that represents administrative
activities associated with the object, such as when it was donated and
by whom, who owns copyright and how might the object legally be used,
any content ratings, what collection it is part of, etc. You might also
find metadata specific to the digital capture of the object, such as
scanner used, resolution of image(s), date scanned and by whom, etc.
:::

## Power of Metadata: Structure

![](images/3.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

::: notes
This slide illustrates the power of the STRUCTURE behind the metadata.
Without the structure (left side of screen), we have a bunch of words
that describe something, but our computerized systems cannot understand
these data, nor can the computer process them. If the left hand side of
the screen were typed on a piece of paper, HOW would we organize it in a
library catalog? In any information system?

The right hand side of the screen shows how the structured fields in the
metadata scheme provide a useful framework for the system to process and
for users to make some sense of.
:::

## Metadata Elements and Semantics {.smaller}

::: panel-tabset
## Introduction

-   Each element needs a name
-   Each element needs a definition (semantics)
-   The semantics describe the information content associated with an
    element
-   Input rules associated with an element

::: notes
Let's break down the parts of a metadata scheme.

Each scheme contains multiple elements. In MARC they are represented
using numeric tags in the range of 0XX-9XX. We will examine the MARC
structure in more depth in Module 7.2

Each element (or think about an element as a field in a database) has
three parts:

1)  a name to identify the element in the field structure
2)  a definition or what is called a semantic, which explains to the
    record creator (and users) what to expect to find entered in that
    field
3)  Input rules or standardized rules for how to create the content
    entered into that field

Any organization system contains a metadata scheme, regardless of
context or form.

## Dublin Core {.smaller}

-   15 elements to represent digital resources
-   Also used for analog resources

![](images/5.png){fig-align="center" width="40%"}

## Many Metadata Schemes

-   Government Information Locator Service (GILS)
    -   Metadata scheme for describing government information
    -   67 elements
-   Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC)
    -   Metadata scheme for describing geospatial information
    -   100+ elements
-   Encoded Archival Description (EAD)
    -   Used within the archival community
-   And many more....
    -   Visual Resources Core, MODS, etc.
:::

::: notes
**Intro 2** -- Here is an example of a metadata element and its parts
taken from one of the most well-known and used metadata schemes, the
Dublin Core. Can you see what is MISSING?

**Dublin core slide** ---- An example of a metadata scheme is the Dublin
Core, developed in the mid 1990's and still being reworked today.

It includes a core set of 15 generic elements at its base, though there
are now many more that have been added to the scheme.

We will come back to Dublin Core and other metadata schemes later but
take some time to explore some of them online and to look at the
different collections they are being used in.

**more scheme** --- Just some more great examples to explore. Look these
up using your favorite search engine.

## Focus So Far, Upcoming Weeks

-   Structuring the representation
    -   Selecting object attributes to represent (based on users, user
        questions, and collection's objects)
    -   Labeling attributes through the metadata elements/field names
    -   Defining the elements (semantics) to indicate information about
        object to record
-   In a few weeks we will try some data modeling

::: notes
This lecture has been a very quick and simple introduction to the
complex concepts of representation and surrogation, bibliographic
control and tools, and metadata and metadata schemes, as well as to the
process and some decisions we make when developing an organization
system.

In the readings for the module you will explore these concepts, tools,
and processes further.

In Module 7, we will take a more in depth look at the application of
representation and a metadata scheme when we discuss bibliographic
control.

Later we will look further at systems and metadata schemes.

Enjoy the readings and be sure to ask questions or post insights as you
read.
