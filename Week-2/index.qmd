# Welcome!

::: notes
Welcome to the Module 1. In this module you will be introduced to the "big picture" of organization of information and knowledge.

In this lecture, we will explore the different dimensions that we consider when we organize knowledge regardless of context, resource formats, or user population.

Throughout the semester each of the topics presented in this lecture will be explored in depth.

However, it cannot be interpreted as database modeling techniques used for organizing entities

## Information -- Some Definitions {.smaller}

> "Something received or obtained through informing. Informing is done through the mechanisms of sending a message or communication; thus, information is "the content of a message" or "something that is communicated." (Svenonius, 2000, p. 7)

"The term document \[...\] to refer to an information-bearing message in recorded form:

-   a piece of information

-   a writing (as a book, report, or letter) conveying information

-   a material having on it (as a coin or stone) a representation of the thoughts of men by means of some conventional mark or symbol" (Svenonius, 2000, p. 8 *apud* Webster's Third New International Dictionary, 1966)

> [Information is an abstract, but the documents that contain it are embodied in some medium, such as paper, canvas, stone, glass, floppy disks, or computer chips. Potentially any medium can serve as a carrier of information"]{style="color: blue;"} (Svenonius, 2000, p. 8)

## Some Distintions

## What is information organization? {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Approaches have evolved over time
-   The digital revolution is prompting us to question established practices and the scope of our responsibility:
    -   `What is a document?`
    -   `What is a collection?`
    -   `What are the best practices for organizing and accessing information resources?`
    -   `How have these things changed?`
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   The creation of a system
    -   `that lets people do things`
        -   finds, manage, select, locate, obtain
    -   `with the things that carry information`
        -   an intellectual or creative work
        -   a text in a specific language
        -   a file with a specific format
        -   a physical item
:::

::: notes
George A. Miller in 1983 coined the term "informavore". Humans are by nature informavores, because it is our innate need to seek out and gather information. Once we "gather" information or knowledge, we need to be able to use it in an effective & efficient manner, we have to organize it in some way.

Thus, information organization is a creation of system that helps us to find, manage, select, locate and obtain things that carry information.
:::

## System of Organization {.smaller}

-   Representation of a thing that carries information
-   Connecting (embedding or associating) description with information objects

## Core library activities {.smaller}

-   Identify, acquire, preserve, and provide access to the world's published knowledge

-   Promote equity of access to information

-   Promote intellectual freedom

-   Support education and continuous learning and research

-   Support the development of information literacy in society

-   Serve as focal points for communities and promote community interests

-   Information organization should work to support all of these activities

## Why do we need information organization? {.smaller}

-   `Understand` \-- We organize information to make sense of it, to make it useful to use in some way

-   `Save time` \-- We organize information to provide information in a timely manner

-   `Collocate` \-- We organize information to bring together things or ideas together into a group

-   `Retrieve` \-- We organize information in order to retrieve it

::: notes
We know pretty well how to find information. The new frontier is to assist users in making sense of it. It may be even better to have a system to process all the raw information and provide a ready-made answer that the user can apply directly, taking a lot of work off the user. Or a system that can read a document and extract the pertinent information, so the user does not have to read the entire thing. These advanced user-friendly functions require sophisticated systems, and we will talk about that as part of the course in Modules 3 & 4
:::

## How do we organize information? {.smaller}

-   Two basic operations

    -   `Lumping`
    -   `Splitting`

-   Grouping things together based on their similarities

-   Differentiating one thing form another

-   Through Representation

::: notes
We will talk more about this in Modules 2-4, but we organize information through two basic operations: lumping and splitting

Lumping is group similar things to form categories or classes. For example, in classification, taxonomy and ontology building, we do lumping where we group together similar entities.

Splitting is differentiating one thing from another and create separate distinct representations for each object in our collection.
:::

## What do we need to know for organizing information? {.smaller}

-   The needs, capabilities, and behaviors of users
-   The nature of information
-   Concepts and processes for describing information objects
-   The way information systems work

::: notes
There are many dimensions we need to know about when organizing information. Some of them are shown on the screen which include the ....

::: notes
We talk about organizing information for one purpose and one purpose only: to assist users.

The needs of the users are central to what we do. We need to assist users in answering questions and solving problems.

We actually need to know quite a bit about our users especially if we hope to effectively connect them with the information they need.

We need to assist users with understanding the information; that means assimilating information, digesting it, and processing it to answer the questions they have and to apply those answers to solve the problem at hand.

## What do we organize? {.smaller}

::: notes
The "universe of knowledge" is an abstract concept, which embraces all knowledge-related objects, events and phenomena and, as such, clearly interacts with the "physical universe".

This figure by T.D. Wilson tries to capture the complex interactions of the physical and abstract universes, where "user's life world" can be defined as the totality of experiences centred upon the individual as an information user. Within this life-world one important sub-world will be the world of work, within which will exist various "reference groups" with which the user identifies: fellow professionals, the peer group within an organization and so on.

The user will be in contact with a variety of "information systems". Within the information system two subsystems are shown: the "mediator" (generally a living system, i.e. a human being) and the "technology", used here in the general sense of whatever combination of techniques, tools and machines constitute the information-searching subsystem.

The information system must have access to various "embodiments of know-ledge", phrased in this general way to indicate that such embodiments may be documents or living people.

The Buckland reading will have you reconsider what a "document" is and how we can organize it/them. Buckland is one of the innovative and philosophical information scientists that we will read this semester.

In LIS, we often refer to information objects that we can organize as the bibliographic universe.

As long as the information is RECORDED in some way, we can organize it. What we cannot organize are intangible objects such as spoken stories or histories. BUT once we record them via video or audio, then we CAN organize them.

## Information Objects

- Books
- Journals
- Paintings
- Websites
- Maps
- Videos
- Music
- Blogs
- Social Media Posts
- Sound Recordings
- Photographs
- Computer
- Files

:::notes
HOW would you organize a blog? Or an mp3 file? Or a podcast?

These are real issues that libraries and information organizations
have to consider. We have good structures for organizing books or even maps, but
what do we do with digital media? 

We will address these issues in Modules 2 and 5.

REPRESENTATION is a central concept in organizing information. There are
actually several levels of representation we will be considering in Module 2.


Representation of an author's expression through book or in sheet music, once it is recorded, it becomes a tangible representation of idea.

The user can now search for and find another representation of the object the database record that describes it, that was created by either a cataloger,
database developer, indexer, etc.
