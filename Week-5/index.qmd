# Introduction

::: notes
In Module 3, we talked about users and information seeking studies and
information behavior research– different ways in which our field and
other fields have modeled users.

In Module 4, we’re going to talk about information systems and
databases, database design, and database modeling. We’re going to look
at information systems from a basic system analysis perspective. I’m
going to introduce you to some terminology–so you can better understand
the vocabulary you may encounter in the readings and throughout Module
4.

We will not be getting into in-depth database design or system analysis
in this module and will cover these topics on a very general level. If
you are interested in these topics, I recommend you to enroll in LIS
4683 Database Design for Information Organization course!

But for this class, it’s important for us to understand how systems are
structured and how that impacts some of the choices we make when we
design our own systems or when we create representations within those
systems.

You will also learn more about systems in LIS 5063 Fundamentals of
Information Technology. However, the data modeling that we will do in
this lecture and in the accompanying lecture will give you a jump start
in developing the system for your Organization System assignment.

## Information Systems

`An information system comprises a set of resources for collecting, managing, and providing access to information`

-   These resources may involve:
    -   manual technologies
    -   automated technologies

::: notes
To begin, a very basic definition of an information system is “an
information system comprises a set of resources for collecting,
managing, and providing access to information.”

And these resources may involve manual technologies and automated
technologies.

So, we’re not just thinking about an online database when we’re talking
about an information system.

We could be talking about file cabinets in your office, or we could talk
about file folder systems within a human resources department. All of
these are different kinds of information systems.

## Information Containers and Content

-   Information in an information system is in some tangible form -- we
    can manipulate it

-   Information objects have two aspects:

    -   `Information container`: [physical embodiment of
        information]{style="color: orange;"}
    -   `Information content`: [intellectual contents of information
        object]{style="color: orange;"} recorded in some fashion

-   Many information systems utilize representations or surrogates of
    the information objects

-   The surrogates are what get manipulated in most cases, but with Web,
    digital libraries, etc. we now access the object as well

::: notes
We can also categorize information into two different buckets
--containers and content–- we’ll revisit this idea several times
throughout the semester.

Information in an information system is in some tangible form, meaning
that we can manipulate it, we can organize it, we can move it around or
change it if necessary.

'In some tangible form', means it can be in any form of object, virtual,
electronic, digitized, print–doesn’t matter. The information is also
what Buckland calls “information as thing” in the Buckland reading.

Information objects have two very basic aspects. They deal with the
container aspects, or the physical aspects, of the information but they
deal with the aspects of the object that describe the physical object
rather than the other component, which is the content.

When we talk about information content in libraries and information
science, we deal with the intellectual content, or what the object is
about. In other words, what subject or representation of the author’s
ideas has been recorded in some fashion within the object.

So, we have two buckets. We have a bucket for the **container aspect**
and we have another bucket for the **content aspect**. In a few minutes
we’ll talk about what would be included in each of those different
areas.

Many information systems utilize representations to connect users with
the objects. For example, a library card catalog, whether it’s in a
print form in a set of drawers or it may be an online catalog, you’re
actually accessing a representation of an object rather than the object.
So, a MARC catalog record or a library card catalog record are
representations, or surrogates, of the object–not the actual object.

However, with the Web and digital collections, we now can access more
than just the surrogate; we can access the object.

## Systems and Systems Thinking

-   `System`: Consists of a number of components working together to
    achieve some purpose
-   Two important aspects
    -   interacting components/subsystems
    -   purposeful
-   System concepts
    -   Inputs
    -   Transformation processes
    -   Outputs
    -   Feedback

::: notes
Now, when we think about systems from a system analysis perspective, we
drill down to the different components of a system. A system is defined
as “consisting of a number of components that work together to achieve
some purpose.” And again, this doesn’t just have to apply to technical
systems only; this concept can apply to any kind of a system. I was
reading my son’s biology textbook, and the authors are describing how
organisms have to be in line in the environment in order for that system
to work. I hadn’t quite thought of that as a system before, but
lightbulbs go on.

In library and information science the system we’re most concerned about
is an information retrieval system, or even a library integrated system.
They have different components that work together to achieve a purpose,
or a set of purposes.

Systems have different inputs, transformative processes, outputs, and
feedback.

## Four Components of an Information System

![](images/1.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
An information system is an socio-technical system comprised of two
sub-systems: a technical sub-system and a social sub-system.

The technical sub-system encompasses the technology and process
components, while the social sub-system encompasses the people and
structure components.

## Structure of Information System

![](images/clipboard-2640168974.png)

:::notes
For instance, this is a model of the components of a system. 

The system has input from one side–people with problems and resulting information needs. 

On the other side, the system has input that’s created by a cataloger or an indexer, where information professionals describe or create surrogates of the objects in the collection. 

These representations are put into an information system, there’s a transformative process, or a retrieval matching process, and the output is information given back to the user that hopefully matches those two inputs. 

So, from a systems perspective, an information system has one or more goals and objectives to perform.
